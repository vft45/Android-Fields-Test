Summary: This project uses smartphone technology to test visual fields with a virtual reality style headset.

Essence: The idea of a 3D printed headset is that - in time - this will lessen the cost, making it relatively quick and easy to create in any location. With regard to the software, the mission is to create a practical easy-to-use program, with single click result sharing, and fast test times. To achieve this with the lower computational resources available on a smartphone, there must be a sensible approach to the design and purpose of this project overall. A headset field system currently would not replace a conventional perimeter bowl, and not be as accurate; therefore it would not replace any existing field test, only supplement any existing results. Nevertheless there is some potential for home monitoring, and for testing of those who cannot be tested by conventional means.

For any release on Google app-store, the plan is to release a free or nearly free version (i.e. to cover any costs) very shortly.

Disclaimer: PLEASE BE AWARE! This is not a commercial product, and is untested. The software is not currently available for general release. Not for use in the United States of America. For personal use only.

The software is designed to run on Android OS only. Smartphones have higher screen resolutions now (over 1800 pixels on around a 5 inch display width) and this permits a pixel density that lets you display a spot III stimulus size (0.43 degrees), within around 30 degrees from fixation.

For the headset, 3D printed parts will be uploaded here in due course, as they are fine-tuned. The headset is being designed and tweaked in Openscad, contributions to this are welcome. Openscad is simple to program, although it is c++ based, it is not a fully scripted language. From Openscad, .stl files are created that can then be printed.

At this stage, a 3D printed models have a very functional look. It is easier at present to buy pre-made sets. Those with 3D printers already however might be tempted to print headsets and experiment with new designs. The front rim of the headset, for some versions, should be readily wipeable, so it can be cleaned between tests. Also, an IPD system is required, as is a front casing that either fits most glasses inside the rim, or facilitates the addition of trial lenses.

The Homido headset is an inexpensive headset that is available now, and it is priced @ 89.90 Euros http://www.homido.com. It is one of the better headsets as it has adjustable IPD and the lens diameter is a little larger. The lens quality is fair, and it accepts a range of smartphones (see online for the range accepted). It fits a Samsung NOTE 3 / NOTE 4 exceptionally well. 

There are obvious limitations of using a smartphone, with the variation in brightness between devices, with the optical edge lens effects varying depending on the type of headset / lens included. The lenses are clearly inferior on those supplied with Google cardboard kits (being too small), and the effect of edge aberrations will likely have an effect on inter-test variability in such cases. With a larger diameter lens, it is possible to readily measure 10-2, 24-2 and 30-2 type fields.
