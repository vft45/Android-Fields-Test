Summary: This project uses smartphone technology to test 24 degree visual fields with 
a virtual reality style headset.

Essence: The general plan is to make this available as inexpensively as possible,
which is the reason for the 3D printed models - in time this will lessen the
cost, and will be quicker to create. For any release on Google app-store, the plan is 
to release a free or nearly free version (i.e. to cover any costs) very shortly.

Disclaimer: PLEASE BE AWARE! This is not a commercial product, and is untested.
The software is not currently available for general release. Not for use in the 
United States of America. For personal use only.

The software is designed to run on Android OS only. Smartphones have higher screen
resolutions now (over 1800 pixels on around a 5 inch display width) and this permits
a pixel density that lets you display a spot III stimulus size (0.43 degrees), within 
around 30 degrees from fixation.

For the headset, 3D printed parts will be uploaded here in due course, 
as they are fine-tuned. The headset is being designed and tweaked in Openscad, 
contributions to this are welcome. Openscad is simple to program, although it
is c++ based, it is not a fully scripted language. From Openscad, .stl files 
are created that can then be printed.

At this stage, a 3D printed models have a very functional look. It is easier at 
present to buy pre-made sets. Those with 3D printers already however might be 
tempted to print headsets and experiment with new designs. The front rim of the
headset, for some versions, should be readily wipeable, so it can be cleaned
between tests. 

The Homido headset is an inexpensive headset that is available now, and it is
priced @ 89.90 â‚¬http://www.homido.com. It is one of the better headsets 
as it has adjustable IPD and the lens diameter is a little wider. The lens quality 
is fair, and it accepts a range of smartphones (see online for the range accepted)
but it definitely fits a Samsung NOTE 3 / NOTE 4 pretty well.
